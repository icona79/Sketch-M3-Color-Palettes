# Sketch Material Design 3 theme importer

With this plugin you can import themes genrated from the [Material Them Builder](https://goo.gle/material-theme-builder-web).

The plugin imports the JSON token files generated by the official tool and generates a set of Color Variables, Layer Styles and Text Styles.

You will find:

-   all the color palette available as Color Variables
-   light and dark themes as layer styles (both fills and borders)
-   light and dark themes as text styles
